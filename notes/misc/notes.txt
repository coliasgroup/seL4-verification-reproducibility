gcc 4.9 has at least same failures as 6

handleSyscall and handleInterruptEntry "Refinement NOT proven":
    - these are the only two functions that call (inline) getActiveIRQ
    - issue is irqInvalid being inlined in C but not in ASM
        - solutions:
            static const
            const
            enum

handle NORETURN:

Missing nodes after calls to instruction'isb_sy_E0000540
  in ['fpsimd_HWCapTest']
Missing nodes after calls to restore_user_context

NORETURN functions don't make sense (including slowpath)

adding VISIBLE to slowpath doesn't work

create_untyped:
    #pragma GCC optimize ("O0")
        - all deps pass
        - proof found, checking hasn't finished yet

    O2, split at "/* There is a part of the kernel (code/data) that is only needed for the"
        just above works
        just below doesn't work
