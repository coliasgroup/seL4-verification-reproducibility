gcc 4.9 has at least same failures as 6

handleSyscall and handleInterruptEntry "Refinement NOT proven":
    - these are the only two functions that call (inline) getActiveIRQ
    - issue is irqInvalid being inlined in C but not in ASM
        - solutions:
            static const
            const
            enum
